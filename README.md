# Jewel
 A small gradual-typed programming language built using Javascript. 
 
Gradual typing is a type system that allows variables and expressions to be given types at compile-time (like C or Java e.g. int x = 1;) or to be left untyped and evaluated at run-time (like Javascript or Python e.g. var x = 1;)
