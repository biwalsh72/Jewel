# Jewel
 A small gradual-typed programming language built using Javascript. 

## What is gradual typing?
Gradual typing is a type system that allows variables and expressions to be given types at compile-time:

 -  **like C or Java**  --- int x = 1;

or to be left untyped and evaluated at run-time: 

 -  **like Javascript or Python**  --- var x = 1;
